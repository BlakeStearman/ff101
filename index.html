							<img src="img/packed pool.jpg" width="250">
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">These players are free agents.</p>
						<p class="fragment">So how does the waiver wire work?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Every week, free agents are put on waivers.
						<p class="fragment">Temporary freeze on unclaimed players,</p>
						<p class="fragment">giving everyone a chance to make a claim.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						The waiver period lasts from start of Sunday games until midnight Tuesday midnight, or for two days after a player has been dropped.
						<p class="fragment">When waiver period ends, all claims are processed.</p>
						<p class="fragment">If two claims are for the same player, claim with highest waiver priority wins.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Waiver priority resets each week to inverse of standings. Last place player has highest priority.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Once waivers run, remaining players are again free agents.
						<p class="fragment">Free agents can be added at will, first come, first serve.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Runs from Wednesday morning until the beginning of the Sunday games.</p>
